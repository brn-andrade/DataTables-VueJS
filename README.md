> Vuetable-2 [Tutorial](https://github.com/ratiw/vuetable-2-tutorial/tree/master/doc) using Bootstrap 3 CSS

You can use the same tutorial content [here](https://github.com/ratiw/vuetable-2-tutorial/blob/master/doc/README.md), just use the code in this repo instead.

The code in this repo is modified to use Bootstrap 3 CSS instead of Semantic UI.

## Setup

Clone the project and install it using `npm` or `yarn`.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# each lesson contains the code that is tagged according to the lesson itself.
# to select the code for lesson 1
git checkout lesson-1

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

```

Find any mistake? Open an issue and I'll have a look. Cheers!
